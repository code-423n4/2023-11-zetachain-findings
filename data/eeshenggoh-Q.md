## Unused contracts should be removed
These unused contracts should be removed, it can be misleading to developers and gas if accidentally deployed
```
repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/Uniswap.sol
repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/UniswapPeriphery.sol
```

## Zero Address Check

Apparently ** ALL THE CONTRACT IN SCOPE ** has no zero address check which means that you can accidentally transfer to zero address or deploy contracts with null address. Do include zero address checks in ALL contracts in scope. I did not add code lines here as there is too much.

## Ancient Pragma Version
The contract `repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/WZETA.sol` uses Ancient Complier Version `pragma solidity ^0.4.18;` which has integer overflow and underflow. Do use the latest version and use it consistently throughout the contracts.

## Missing Receive() function
The contract `repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/tools/ZetaTokenConsumerUniV2.strategy.sol` receives ether to swap for tokens, it is great practice to have a receive or fallback function for contracts that receives ether.
