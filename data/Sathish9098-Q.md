## [L-1] Hardcoded ChainId

### Impact
In systems where signatures are used for authentication or transaction verification, a hardcoded CHAIN_ID can cause issues if the networkâ€™s chain ID changes. This could invalidate existing signatures or compromise the integrity of new ones.

For protocols designed to operate across multiple chains, a hardcoded CHAIN_ID can limit functionality. It may prevent the protocol from correctly identifying and interacting with different networks, thereby reducing its cross-chain operability.

Hardcoding CHAIN_ID can create hurdles when moving a contract from a testnet to the mainnet or vice versa, as these environments typically have different chain IDs.
