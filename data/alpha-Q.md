[L-1] Validating initializationCode Length and Eliminating Redundant Code
Validating the length of initializationCode is essential, and the computation of targetDeploymentAddress is unnecessary at this stage; it can be checked after a successful deployment. The following is the final code with other optimization:
```solidity
File: repos/protocol-contracts/evm/tools/ImmutableCreate2Factory.sol
 function safeCreate2Internal(
        bytes32 salt,
        bytes memory initializationCode
    ) internal returns (address deploymentAddress) {
        require(initializationCode.length != 0, "Bytecode length is zero");
        // using inline assembly: load data and length of data, then call CREATE2.
        assembly {
            deploymentAddress := create2(
                callvalue, // wei sent with current call
                // Actual code starts after skipping the first 32 bytes
                add(initializationCode, 0x20),
                mload(initializationCode), // Load the size of code contained in the first 32 bytes
                salt // Salt from function arguments
            )
        }
        require(deploymentAddress != address(0), "Failed on deploy");
        // ensure that a contract hasn't been previously deployed to target address.
        require(!_deployed[deploymentAddress], "Contract deployed.");
        // record the deployment of the contract to prevent redeploys.
        _deployed[deploymentAddress] = true;
    }

```
