# Zetachain Security Analysis Report

### Overview
ZetaChain aims to be an interoperable blockchain ecosystem enabling cross-chain transactions. As such, security is paramount. This report attempts to analyze attack surfaces and make recommendations. It attempts to provide feedback on security, decentralization, and trust considerations for interoperability systems.

### Evaluation Approach
A whitebox review was conducted analyzing trust assumptions, privilege separation, access controls, and systemic architectural risks.

### Architecture Recommendations
Interoperability networks introduce unique adversarial models. A democratically governed validity scheme backed by novel crypto-economics can offer robustness and accountability. Formal properties like composability, liveliness, and fairness should be established among zkRollup sidechains. Modular upgrades matched to risk profiles balance agility and attack surfaces.  

### Codebase Quality
Best practices around failing early on transfers, reentrancy guards, input validation, and event emissions are followed. Additional rigor ensuring overflow checks in arithmetic operations and monitoring gas usage would prove prudent. Upgradable proxy patterns warrant consideration to offset immutability downsides pending further audit.

### Centralization Risks
Administrative concentration among Bridge Authorities and Fungible handlers pose undue influence risks. A transparent, community-driven governance model for managing privileged roles and upgrades adhering to principles of least authority merits design priority for retaining decentralization promises at scale.  

### Mechanism Analysis 
Rigorous mathematical models rooted in game theory, adversarial analysis and cryptoeconomic protections should drive development of cross-chain mechanisms, sidechain incentives, and Inter Blockchain Communication protocols to satisfy safety, liveness and fairness guarantees under a variety of failure modes and coordinated attacks.

### Systemic Risks  
Composability risks, parasitic sidechain attacks, stake dilution, and federated byzantine faults require modeling atop cryptographic assumptions and governance controls. An incentive compatible decentralized governance framework to balance security across bridges and chains merits priority research focus. 

### Trust Model
ZetaChain has a complex trust model involving chain connectors, Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) multi-sig validators, fungible modules, and whitelisted contracts. Validators and whitelisted contracts must be properly decentralized and implemented for security.

### Privileged Roles
Several contracts such as SystemContract, ZRC20, and ERC20Custody have a "fungible module" address with special owner-like privileges to update parameters or manage tokens. This address must be controlled in a decentralized manner with proper multi-sig schemes.

### Reentrancy 
The code contains usage of low level calls like call/send for Uniswap and cross-chain operations. Care must be taken to avoid reentrancy attacks during these external calls. Checks before state changes are recommended.

### Access Controls
Access controls around sensitive functionality like withdrawals and contract upgrades are enforced. This reduces attack surface from unauthorized usage of such features. Proper decentralization of validator set can improve this.

### Token Security
Zeta tokens implement the standard ERC20 along with additional cross-chain mechanisms. Overflow and loss of token scenarios during cross-chain actions should be analyzed further. 

### Upgradability
Several components like the Uniswap trading router are non-upgradeable. 

### Conclusion
Overall ZetaChain introduces a novel architecture for interchain transactions but this expands the attack surface.
