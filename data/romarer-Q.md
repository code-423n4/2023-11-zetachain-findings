I did not find any critical bugs, but here is some inconsistencies 

The code uses both `cosmoserrors.Wrapf` and direct error returns. It's crucial to ensure that errors are handled consistently throughout the codebase. Inconsistent error handling can lead to missed errors or difficulties in debugging.

 Functions like `CallEVMWithData` use gas estimation and provide mechanisms to set custom gas limits. It's important to ensure these estimations are accurate and that the system can handle cases where the actual gas required exceeds the estimate.
