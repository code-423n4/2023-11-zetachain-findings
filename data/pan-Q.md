# contracts/evm/ERC20Custody.sol

The [constructor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/main/repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/ERC20Custody.sol#L68) of `ERC20Custody` does not perform a ZeroAddress check for `TSSAddress` and `TSSAddressUpdater`. If the contract deployed with either `TSSAddress` or `TSSAddressUpdater` set to the zero address it would mean no address is authorized to perform the operations guarded by `onlyTSS` and `onlyTSSUpdater` modifiers, locking functions using them. Checking [`updateTSSAddress()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/main/repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/ERC20Custody.sol#L80) and [`renounceTSSAddressUpdater()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-zetachain/blob/main/repos/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/ERC20Custody.sol#L107) further reinforces the idea that a zero check was meant to be present.
